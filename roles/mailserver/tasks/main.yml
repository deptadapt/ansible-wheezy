# This will install and configure Postfix, Dovecot, and a bunch of related
# tools. 

# This task instructs debconf not to configure Postfix.
# The playbook will supply the necessary Postfix configuration,
# and we don't want debconf to interfere with this, including future
# upgrades of the package.

# This task demonstrates how to install everything in one go using
# the with_items keyword.
#
# For now I've got it commented out as I am doing prep and clean-up tasks
# for some of these packages.
#
# Also note: PostgreSQL should perhaps be in its own role, with this role
# depending on it.
