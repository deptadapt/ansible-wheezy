# This file is used by moin-mass-migrate script to migrate the listed
# wikis. Run this script when upgrading moin to an incompatible new
# version that requires migrating data.
#
# moin-mass-migrate su's to the listed user and then runs moin migration
# with the specified protocol-stripped url.
#
# It's also possible to let a user list setup files in ~user/.moin/wikilist
# in their home directory. To do so, list only the user's name, without
# url. The format of ~/.moin/wikilist is the same as this file.
