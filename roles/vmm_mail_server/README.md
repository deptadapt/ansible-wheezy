# A role for a mail server

This role installs Postfix and Dovecot with a database backend for 
authentication stored in PostgreSQL and managed by vmm.

This role was originally developed for Ansible 1.2 and will be updated
soon for newer Ansible features.

By default Postfix and Dovecot are configured to use the snakeoil SSL
certificate generated by the ssl-cert Debian package, but a custom
SSL cert/key pair can be provided.

OpenDKIM can also optionally be installed and configured.
